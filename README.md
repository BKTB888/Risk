# Monte-Carlo Simulation for Risk Fights

This repo's only goal, is to prove that I did not make a mistake while calculating the exact probabilities for fights in Risk. 
After completing the project I deemed myself successful, because even in a 10 by 10 fight my results converged usually upto 3 digits to my expected outcomes, with 1 million games simulated.

**The code for the exact probabilities is here:** https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nlyGHUVxSv23_C1Nc-zb1LoYxlsrkrMb?usp=sharing

I used rust mainly for its speed and familiarity. 
There is a lot that could be improved on this code (using threads and making it more readable), but as I know that I have the exact probabilities, why bother?
